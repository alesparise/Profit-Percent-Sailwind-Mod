**Features:**  
• Adds the percentage profit right next to the profit value in the goods trading screen;  
• Colors the profit (and the percentage) in green if its positive, red in negative and yellow if zero.  
**Requirements: Requires BepInEx**  
**Installation:** Download ProfitPercent.dll and move it into the *...\Sailwind\BepInEx\plugins folder*  
  
**Game version:** 0.24.1  
**Mod Version:** 1.0.2  
**Warning:** I don't really know much about programming so this might be buggy. I tested it for a while and didn't have any issue, but please let me know if there are problems. I'd recommend making a backup save, just in case, but I don't think this would break a savegame.  
**Compatibility:** This mod replaces the GetProfitString method in the EconomyUI class. If another mod changes that there will be issues, I suppose. 
If that method or class get changed in the future the mod might stop working, but I'd say for the foreseeable future it should work for a few updates.
